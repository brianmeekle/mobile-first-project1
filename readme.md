### Design Choices

* Color Scheme

I have chosen to use a hex colours below as these are the colors primarily used in any artwork created for Contraband Circus.

##Very Dark Red #6f010a
##Dark Red #8f020b
##Red #d30313
##Black #000000
##White #fbfbfb
##Grey #9f9999


* Typography

The font I have chosen to use is .... and I have chosen .... as a fallback font, in case the .... font does not display properly or display at all in the browser.

* Imagery

I have been authorised to use any previous art created used by Contraband Circus so I compiled a collection of their logos which will be used throughout the website. One of the logos will be turned into a banner which will be used on all of the web pages.
